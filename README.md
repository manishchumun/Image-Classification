Image Classification Project for Udacity Deep Mind Nano degree

In this project, I classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects. The dataset was preprocessed, then I train a convolutional neural network on all the samples. I normalize the images, one-hot encode the labels, build a convolutional layer, max pool layer, and fully connected layer. At then end, you'll see their predictions on the sample images.

Accuracy was around 70%.
